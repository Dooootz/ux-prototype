// The logo should prompt the user to tap/click -- 
// upon actuation, there will be an animation which renders the sign in form (opacity fade in & slide up )-- 

// once the user enters their details the entire page will fade out & redirect them to the next page (animated loading icon whilst page loads)
// (registering new user ? take them to registration / account set up page : sign in )
